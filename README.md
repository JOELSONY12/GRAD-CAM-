**Skin Cancer Detection and Prediction using GradCAM**

**Description**
Skin cancer is one of the most common types of cancers worldwide. Early detection and accurate diagnosis are crucial for effective treatment and improved patient outcomes. This project focuses on the detection and prediction of skin cancer using deep learning techniques. We employ Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify skin lesions as either benign or malignant based on dermatoscopic images. Additionally, we utilize GradCAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping) for visualizing the regions in the images that contribute most to the model's predictions, providing insights into the decision-making process of the model.

**Scope**
Data Collection: We use a dataset comprising dermatoscopic images of skin lesions, categorized as benign or malignant, for training and testing the model.
Model Development: We develop a CNN-based classification model using TensorFlow and Keras to distinguish between benign and malignant skin lesions.
Explainability: We incorporate GradCAM to visualize the important regions in the images that influence the model's predictions, enhancing the interpretability and trustworthiness of the model.
Evaluation: We evaluate the performance of the model using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and the confusion matrix to assess its effectiveness in skin cancer detection.

**Purpose**
The primary purpose of this project is to:

Improve Early Detection: Enhance the early detection of skin cancer by providing a reliable and accurate classification tool for dermatoscopic images, which can aid healthcare professionals in making informed decisions.
Increase Awareness: Raise awareness about the importance of regular skin examinations and early detection of skin cancer among the general public.
Promote Transparency: Utilize explainable AI techniques like GradCAM to provide transparent insights into the model's decision-making process, fostering trust and understanding among users and healthcare providers.
Support Medical Professionals: Assist dermatologists and healthcare professionals by providing a supplementary tool for skin cancer diagnosis, potentially reducing the time and effort required for manual examination and increasing diagnostic accuracy.
